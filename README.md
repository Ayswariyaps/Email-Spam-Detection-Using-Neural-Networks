# Email Spam Detection using Neural Networks

This repository contains a comparative study of neural network models for email spam detection. With the rapid growth of digital communication, spam emails have become a serious issue, often leading to privacy breaches, financial loss, and malware attacks.

To address this problem, the project evaluates multiple deep learning architectures to identify spam emails effectively.

**Objective**

The goal of this study is to analyze and compare the performance of different neural network models and identify the most effective approach for email spam detection.

**Models Compared**
1. Capsule Networks (CapsNet)
2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
4. Transformer-based model (RoBERTa)

**Evaluation Metrics**

The models are compared using standard classification metrics:
1. Accuracy
2. Precision
3. Recall
4. F1-score
5. Support
